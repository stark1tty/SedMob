SedMob
======
*Mobile software for field geologists*

SedMob is an open-source, mobile software package for creating sedimentary logs, targeted for use in tablets and smartphones. The user can create an unlimited number of logs, save data from each bed in the log as well as export and synchronize the data with a remote server. SedMob is designed as a mobile interface to SedLog: a free multiplatform package for drawing graphic logs that runs on PC computers. Data entered into SedMob are saved in the CSV file format, fully compatible with SedLog.

SedLog can be found here: https://sedlog.rhul.ac.uk/

## Attention
Note: I've created a quick and dirty .apk for testing if this still works as a good free and open source data collection tool for fieldwork. Comments and help are welcome. The .apk can be found on the release page here: https://github.com/stark1tty/SedMob/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha
