SedMob for Android
======
*An Android installer for **SedMob**, the FOSS mobile application for field geological and sedimentological core logging*

SedMob is an open-source, mobile software package for creating sedimentary logs, targeted for use in tablets and smartphones. The user can create an unlimited number of logs, save data from each bed in the log as well as export and synchronize the data with a remote server. SedMob is designed as a mobile interface to SedLog: a free multiplatform package for drawing graphic logs that runs on PC computers. Data entered into SedMob are saved in the CSV file format, fully compatible with SedLog.

SedLog can be found here: https://sedlog.rhul.ac.uk/

## Development Notes

v.1.0.0-alpha (18 April 2023): I've created a quick and dirty .apk for testing if this still works as a good free and open source data collection tool for fieldwork. Comments and help are welcome. The [original repo by Pawel Wolniewicz](https://github.com/pwlw/SedMob) is generally contained within the www folder. The .apk can be found on the release page here: https://github.com/stark1tty/SedMob/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha

Right now the interface is installable and mostly navigable, but it is incapable of data entry and functionality.

The hope is to get functionality working and then build it out for sediment core logging.
